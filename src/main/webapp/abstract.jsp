                    This paper identifies research paths for blockchain
                    in cyber security that need further research: Internet of Things
                    (IoT) security has indeed been promoted as a critical industrial
                    necessity, even though almost all publications on blockchain
                    cyber security in literature pointed out that the security of IoT
                    systems can be revived if it is backed by blockchain. Yet, few
                    things are now known and talked about the decision-making and
                    practicality of adopting the technology, or how it may be used
                    realistically to correct existing IoT security risks and threats,
                    providing scope for imagination and the construction of future
                    vectors in this particular area. As a result, future research must
                    establish measurable recommendations and methods that can
                    assist in filling the gaps in the existing literature. There is also
                    the potential to develop solutions for IoT devices with limited
                    resources (operating on the periphery of the network) that are
                    based on blockchain technology.
